function [val0, mu, t, idx] = STL_Culprit(Sys, phi, P, tau, threshold, VERBOSE)
%STL_CULPRIT tries to find out who (which predicate) and when is
% responsible for the value of val0 = rho(phi, traj, tau), for all
% parameter vector of P. This is a brute force implementation: does not try
% to solve conflict (e.g. equality in min or max), and does not verify that
% the value is actually admissible (time might be wrong). It just
% decomposes phi into its predicates, evaluates them and looks for a time
% when value val is reached. It recomputes the evaluation of phi on P using
% the classic evaluation method.
% 
% Synopsis: [val0, mu, t, idx]  = STL_Culprit(Sys, phi, P, tau [, threshold[, VERBOSE]])
% 
% Inputs:
%  - Sys       : The system
%  - phi       : The formula for which we want to find the predicate. If
%                it is a predicate, mu is phi.
%  - P         : The parameter set containing trajectories against which
%                the formula is checked. It may contain many parameter
%                vectors. The trajectories must be computed. If the
%                trajectories are not computed, all output are equals to
%                [], and a warning is thrown. The evaluation of phi does
%                not need to be computed.
%  - tau       : Time step at which we ask for the predicate responsible
%                for the value of phi. It must be a scalar. It is strongly
%                recommended that tau belongs to traj.time, otherwise, the
%                time point t may be not found.
%  - threshold : (Optionnal, default or empty=1.0e-14) Indicates the
%                maximal difference between the evaluation of the formula
%                at a time point and its evalutation at time tau to say
%                that we have found the valid time point t.
%  - VERBOSE   : (Optional, default=true) boolean indicating if the
%                computation progress bar is shown.
% 
% Outputs:
%   - val0 Truth value of phi at time tau. Dimension of val0 is
%          1 x size(P.pts,2).
%   - mu   The predicate responsible for the value val0. It is a cell array
%          of dimension 1 x size(P.pts,2). If, for a parameter vector, the
%          predicate responsible for the evaluation of the formula is not
%          found, mu, at the corresponding index, is empty.
%   - t    time point such that rho(mu, traj, t) == val0. It is an array of
%          dimension 1 x size(P.pts,2). If, for a parameter vector, the
%          predicate responsible for the evaluation of the formula is not
%          found, t, at the corresponding index, is set to NaN.
%   - idx  Index of t in traj.time. If t does not belong to traj.time
%          (typically if phi is a predicate and tau doesn't belong to
%          traj.time), the index of the smallest time point greater that
%          tau is provided, or the last time point if there is no greater
%          time point greater than tau. If, for a parameter vector, the
%          predicate responsible for the evaluation of the formula is not
%          found, idx, at the corresponding index, is set to 0.
% 
%See also STL_SEvalDiff
%
% NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS ARE: FIND OUT WHICH PREDICATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
% VALUE OF PHI FOR EACH PARAMETER SET.

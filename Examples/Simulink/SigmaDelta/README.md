#Â Sigma-Delta Example

The goal is to check generic stability/safety requirements (no saturation) 
under different classes of inputs.

## Wordgen

This examples demonstrates inputs generated with wordgen, thus requires 
wordgen to be properly installed. Specifically, Breach will try to use 
wordgen executable in the Ext/Toolboxes/wordgen folder. If not present or 
compatible with the system, this executable will have to be rebuilt, see
https://git.lacl.fr/barbot/wordgen.
